/* The activation edges the ITU-T state machine permits, indexed by the state
 * being left.
 *
 * One table serves every mode. G.984.3 ranges in O3 where G.9807.1 merges O2
 * and O3 into one state and a MAC has one register code for the merged pair,
 * so a driver reports O2 and then O4. Both edges are legal here because what
 * is being checked is whether a driver reported something impossible, not
 * whether it conforms to one mode's text. A per mode split is worth adding
 * the day a second MAC needs it.
 *
 * O1 is reachable from every state: a loss of signal, a deactivation or the
 * end of TO2 returns the ONU to it. O7 is reachable from O1 to O5, where the
 * OLT's Disable_Serial_Number stops the ONU, but not from O6, which leaves
 * only for O5 or O1. O7 itself leaves only for O1, when the OLT enables the
 * ONU again (G.9807.1 Table C.12.4).
