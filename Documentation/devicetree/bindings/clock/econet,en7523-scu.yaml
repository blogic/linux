description: |
  This node defines the System Control Unit of the EN7523 SoC,
  which is a collection of registers configuring a lot of different
  aspects of the SoC.
  The clock driver uses it to read and configure settings of the
  PLL controller, which provides clocks for the CPU, the bus and
  other SoC internal peripherals.

  Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
  to specify the clock which they consume.

  All these identifiers could be found in:
  [1]: <include/dt-bindings/clock/en7523-clk.h>.

  The clocks are provided inside a system controller node.
